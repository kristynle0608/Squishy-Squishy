## Title of Game
Squishy Squishy: A 2D - Platformer Game

## Description
**Squishy Squishy: A 2D - Platformer Game** follows the tutorial of 'Coding with Flow' on YouTube.

The game itself contains:
- A main character that the player can play with
- 4 levels (ranging from easy to difficult)
- Cherries so that the player can collect them throughout the game
- Traps to make the game more interesting

Game engine that is used:
- Unity (Learned in course CS2053: Intro to Game Development)


Goals:
- Review concepts that were taught during CS2053
- Improve game development skills by learning how to make game features that are not taught in the course
- Learn how to make a game that I would actually want to play

Features that I wanted to add but didn't:
- Wall Jumping -> Tried but it didn't work. Hopefully will add wall jumping in future projects
- Pause Menu -> Was unable to figure out how to jump from the pause menu scene back to the previous scene that the player was playing. Need to find more tutorials on how to do this
