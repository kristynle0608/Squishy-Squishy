## Title of Game
Squishy Squishy: A 2D - Platformer Game

## Description
**Squishy Squishy: A 2D - Platformer Game** follows the tutorial of 'Coding in Flow' on YouTube. Player has to make it to the finish line while also try to avoid traps that are set along the way. 
- Levels 1 and 2 follow the design of the tutorial 
- Levels 3 and 4 are designed by me

### The game contains:
- A main character that the player can play with
- 4 levels (ranging from easy to difficult)
- Cherries so that the player can collect them throughout the game
- Traps to make the game more interesting

### Controls in Game
- Press `A` or `left-arrow key` to move left
- Press `D` or `right-arrow key` to move right
- Press `spacebar` to jump
- Press `escape` to return back to main menu

### Game engine that is used:
- Unity (Learned in course CS2053: Intro to Game Development)


### Goals:
- Review concepts that were taught during CS2053
- Improve game development skills by learning how to make game features that are not taught in the course
    - Making animations look smoother
    - Using the animator
    - Coding player's death
    - Using tools in the Tile Palette to draw tiles more efficiently
    - Make Start and End screens
- Learn how to make a game that I would actually want to play

### Features that I wanted to add but didn't:
- Wall Jumping -> Tried but it didn't work. Hopefully will add wall jumping in future projects
- Pause Menu -> Was unable to figure out how to jump from the pause menu scene back to the previous scene that the player was playing. Need to find more tutorials on how to do this
